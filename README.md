# Sanctum-of-Cthulhu-Modlist

Boy do I have some good news for you. 

You can download one of the files in this repository and use it to overwrite your local modlist file.
Your local modlist file is in the following folder:
<path_to_Steam>\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

For instance, my Steam folder is in the F: drive, so mine looks like this:
F:\Steam\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

For many of you it will likely be:
C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

I've tried to include multiple files with common drive paths for people with more than one mapped drive.

Just make sure the path that the file is pointing to is the right folder, okay?

**If you set this up correctly, Conan will have a slightly longer load time on the initial launch, then it will load directly into our server after you join it.**
