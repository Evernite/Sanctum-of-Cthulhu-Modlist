# Sanctum-of-Cthulhu-Modlist

Boy do I have some good news for you. 

You can copy and paste the contents of the file in this repository and use it to overwrite your local modlist.txt file.
Your local modlist.txt file is in the following folder:
<path_to_Steam>\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

For instance, my Steam folder is in the F: drive, so mine looks like this:
F:\Steam\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

For many of you it will likely be:
C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

The 'autodetect' file should work on any Windows machine.

Just make sure the path that the file is pointing to is the right folder, okay?

**If you set this up correctly, Conan will have a slightly longer load time on the initial launch, then it will load directly into our server after you join it.**


# Step 1
### 1. Locate your modlist folder and check where your Steam folder is located. In my case, it is F:\Steam
### <path_to_Steam>\steamapps\common\Conan Exiles\ConanSandbox\Mods\modlist.txt

### 2. Open the modlist file here.
### 3. Copy the contents into your modlist.txt file in the Steam folder.
